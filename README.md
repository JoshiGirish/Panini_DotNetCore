**PANINI** is a topic recommendation tool that makes it easier for technical writers to interlink topics of a guide. For each topic in the guide, the tool proposes similar topics depending on relevance rankings.


**PANINI** uses basic `Natural Language Processing` and `Machine Learning` techniques to process a set of web topics and compute cosine similarity scores using `Term-Frequency Inverse Document-Frequency` (TFIDF) measure. The tool provides useful statistics like:
- *Topic Recommendations* that can be used to incorporate inline and related links.
- *Keyword Recommendations* that can be used as pre-defined search queries.
- *Word Rankings* that define how unique a word is to a topic.
- *Topic Summary* which in the form of number of existing inline links, related links, sentences, and words.
- *Similarity Heatmap* which provides a visual overview of similarity scores.
